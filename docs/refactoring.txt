Random walker was already provided. The main aim is to make the RandomWalker(which performs random walking) as the parent element,
and any other special walk which is demanded will be made as a child of the randomWalker class which will
inherit most of the functionality from it and perform the specific walk by overriding the walk method.

Refactoring 1: make a new class named SpiralWalker.java which will extend RandomWalker.java

Refactoring 2: make the constructor and override the walk method for the SpiralWalker.java and import the rest of the methods
from RandomWalker.java

Refactoring 3: implement a separate method for SpiralWalker.java which performs function according to the
lab pdf requirements

Refactoring 4: make a new class named BreadCrumbWalker.java which will extend RandomWalker.java

Refactoring 5: make the constructor and override the walk method for the BreadCrumbWalker.java and import the rest of the methods
from RandomWalker.java

Refactoring 6: implement a separate method for BreadCrumbWalker.java which performs function according to the
lab pdf requirements

Refactoring 7: handle the input format according to the instructions given(Extension 1).

Refactoring 8: handle the output format according to the instructions given(Extension 4).
